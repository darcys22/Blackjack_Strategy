This is the beginning of a tutor for counting cards in blackjack. Not anywhere near finished and was mostly so I could practice OOP concepts.

TODO
* Think soft seven strategy is wrong
	|===> Actually completely redo the strategy array its fucking stupid
* _DONE_ Make command line arguments work rather than asking for mode on new board
* there is no error checking at all yet

* You need a makefile to compile this shit. LEARN THAT FAGGOT
