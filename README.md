This is the beginning of a tutor for counting cards in blackjack. Not anywhere near finished and was mostly so I could practice OOP concepts.

TODO
* Think soft seven strategy is wrong
	|===> Actually completely redo the strategy array its fucking stupid


* Try to do some error checking 
*find some forums that will check it and tell me where I am completely wrong
